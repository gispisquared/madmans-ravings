\subsection{Integer Polynomials}
An integer polynomial is a polynomial with integer coefficients.
\begin{result}{\label{r:i:n:p:1}}
    In Result~\ref{r:i:a:polys:2}, if $A$ and $B$ have rational coefficients,
    then $Q$ and $R$
    have rational coefficients. If $A$ and $B$ have integer coefficients and $B$
    is monic, then $Q$ and $R$ have integer coefficients.
\end{result}
\begin{result}{\label{r:i:n:p:2}}
    If $p$ is an integer polynomial and $a$ and $b$ are
    integers, then $a-b\mid p(a)-p(b)$.
\end{result}
\begin{result}[Rational Root Theorem]{\label{r:i:n:p:3}}
  If $p$ is an integer polynomial with leading coefficient $a_0$,
  and $y$ and $z$ are integers with $\gcd(y,z)=1$
    such that $p(y/z)=0$, then $z\mid a_0$ and $y\mid p(0)$.
\end{result}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:p:1}}
  Prove that every nonconstant integer polynomial has a composite number
    in its image.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:p:2}}
  Let $P$ be an integer polynomial such that if $P(x)$ is an integer then
    $x$ is rational. Prove that $P$ is linear.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:p:3}}
  Prove that for every polynomial $P(x)$ of degree at least 2 with integer
    coefficients, there is an infinite arithmetic
    progression of integers which does not contain $P(k)$ for any integer $k$.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:p:4}}
  Prove that if $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and leading term $a_0n^k$ such
    that $m\mid P(n)$ for all $n$, then $m\mid k!a_0$.
\end{problem}
