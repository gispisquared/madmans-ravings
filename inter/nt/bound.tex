\subsection{Bounding}
This subsection is all about finding bounds on a variable in a problem. Once you do
that, there are finitely many cases to check and those cases are usually not
difficult.

Techniques:
\begin{itemize}
  \item WLOG arguments: break symmetry to bound one of the variables.
  \item Bound the output of a monotonic function between consecutive values.
  \item If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b\ne 0$ and $a\mid b$ then
    $|a|\le|b|$. Thus, try to get big dividing small. Polynomial long division
    is helpful here.
  \item Look for ``dominant terms'' that grow larger than everything else. For
    sufficiently large $n$ and any $c>1$, we have $c\ll\log n\ll n^c\ll c^n\ll
    n!\ll n^n$ (Result~\ref{r:a:n:b:1}).
  \item If you need to prove a specfic bound of the form ``$f(x)>g(x)$ for
    $x>k$,'' try induction.
  \item If you have a factorial, $n!\equiv 0\pmod c$ for $n\ge c$ so mods are
    often nice.
\end{itemize}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:b:1}}
   Find all positive integers $k$ such that there is a positive integer $n$
    for which
    \[k=\frac{n^2-29}{3n+11}.\]
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:b:2}}
  Find all positive integers $a,b,c$ such that $ab+bc+ca=abc+2$.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:b:3}}
  Prove that if $n>11$ then $n^2-19n+89$ is not a square.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:i:n:b:4}}
  Find all positive integers $n$ such that $2^n\le (n+1)^2$.
\end{problem}
