\section{Descent}
Descent works like this: assign some positive integer quantity
(the ``size'' of a solution, e.g.\ the sum of the absolute values of the
variables) to each solution, take the solution with lowest
``size'' that doesn't fit your claimed pattern and derive a contradiction.
\begin{problem}{\label{p:n:n:d:1}}
    Find all solutions in integers to $a^3+2b^3+4c^3=0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:n:n:d:2}}
    Let's say you have a set $S$ of positive rational numbers such that
      $1\in S$, and if $x\in S$ then both $x+1$ and $\frac 1x$ are in $S$. Prove
      that $S$ contains all positive rationals.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:n:n:d:3}}
    Prove that if $x, y, z$ are integers such that $x^2+y^2+z^2=(xy)^2$,
      then $x=y=z=0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{\label{p:n:n:d:4}}
    A list of $2022$ positive integers is given, such that if you remove
      any one of them, the rest can be split into two groups of equal sum.
      Prove that all the numbers in the list are equal.
\end{problem}
