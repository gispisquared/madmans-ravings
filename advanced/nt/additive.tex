\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\{A, B, C\}$ a partition of $(1, 2,
        3, \ldots, 3n)$ such that $|A| = |B| = |C| = n$. 
        Prove that there exist $x \in A, y \in B, z \in C$ such that one of $x,
        y, z$ is the sum of the other two. 
    \item Suppose that every integer has been given one of the colors 
    red, blue, green or yellow. Let $x$ and $y$ be odd integers so that 
    $|x| \ne |y|$. Show that there are two integers of the same color whose difference
    has one of the following values: $x$, $y$, $(x+y)$ or 
    $(x-y)$.  

    \item Let $k$, $m$, $n$ be integers satisfying $1 < n \le m-1 \le k$. Determine 
    the maximum size of a subset $S$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ such that 
    no $n$ distinct elements of $S$ add up to $m$.

    \item A set $S$ of distinct integers is called sum-free if there does not 
    exist a triple $\{x, y, z\}$ of integers in $S$ such that $x + y = z$. Show 
    that for any set $X$ of distinct integers, $X$ has a sum-free subset 
    $Y$ such that $|Y| > |X|/3$.

    \item Prove that there exists a four-coloring of the set $M = \{1,2,\ldots,1987\}$
    such that any arithmetic progression with 10 terms in the set M is not monochro-
    matic.
