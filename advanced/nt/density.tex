\subsection{Density Arguments}
The technique here is to estimate how many objects (usually numbers or
expressions) have a specific property and lie in a specific range. The aim is
usually to apply pigeonhole.

Perhaps some examples will be clearer:
\begin{result}[Thue's Lemma]{\label{r:a:n:den:1}}
  Let $n>1$ be an integer, and let $a$ be an integer coprime to $n$. 
      There exist integers $x,y$ with $0<|x|<\sqrt n$, $0<|y|<\sqrt n$ and
      $ay\equiv x\pmod n$.
\end{result}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Is there a positive integer which can be written as the sum of 2023
    distinct 2022nd powers in at least 2021 different ways?
  \item Prove that every positive integer is the root of a polynomial all of whose
      coefficients are of the form $2^a-2^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.
\end{itemize}
