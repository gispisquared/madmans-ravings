\subsection{Descent}
The following is something of a Fundamental Theorem of Vieta Jumping.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be well-known enough that you can use it
without proof, so you should know the proof well enough that you can reproduce
it in contest if necessary.
\begin{result}{\label{r:a:n:d:1}}
  Let $a,b,k$ be nonnegative integers such that $\gcd(a,b)=1$,
    and let $t=a^2+b^2-kab$. If $|t-2|<k$ then $t=1$.
\end{result}
Another important application of descent is the Pell equation:
\begin{result}{\label{r:a:n:d:2}}
      Let $d$ be a positive integer which is not a perfect square.
      There exist positive integers $x_0,y_0$ such that $x_0^2-dy_0^2=1$ and 
      for any pair $x,y$ of
      positive integers satisfying $x^2-dy^2=1$, there is a positive integer $k$
      satisfying
      \[x+y\sqrt d=(x_0+y_0\sqrt d)^k.\]
\end{result}
There is an analogous version for $x^2-dy^2=-1$:
\begin{result}{\label{r:a:n:d:3}}
      Let $d$ be a positive integer which is not a perfect square.
      There exist positive integers $x_0,y_0$ such that 
      for any pair $x,y$ of
      positive integers satisfying $x^2-dy^2=-1$, there is an odd positive integer $k$
      satisfying
      \[x+y\sqrt d=(x_0+y_0\sqrt d)^k.\]
\end{result}
Note that in this case solutions to the equation don't necessarily exist, e.g.
by a mod 3 argument.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prove that there are infinitely many triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive
    integers in arithmetic progression
    such that $ab+1$, $bc+1$ and $ca+1$ are all perfect squares.
  \item Find all solutions in integers to $x^2+y^2+z^2=2xyz$.
    \item Find all positive integers $n$ such that \[\sqrt{\frac{7^n+1}2}\] is
      prime.
\end{itemize}
