\part{Methods of Proof}
Since I refuse to rehash stuff that others have done better (read: I'm too
lazy to do it better myself), I'll refer you to a couple of resources about how
to write proofs properly:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/articles/how-to-write-a-solution}
    {How to Write a Maths Solution}
  \item Chapter 1 of the
    \href{https://web.evanchen.cc/textbooks/OTIS-Excerpts.pdf}{OTIS Excerpts}
\end{itemize}

Cool, hopefully now you know how to write proofs. Guess that means every time
you solve a problem you'll get a 7, right?
